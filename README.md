# compoisson_goal
Repository for the project on the Conway-Maxwell Poisson Goal model for association football scores.

- 'utils.R': contains all miscellaneous functions needed to import data, working with MH objects, creating predictions;
- 'MH_Football_Poisson.R': Contains the MH algorithm to infer the parameters for the Poisson Goal model;
- 'MH_Football_COMPois_GlobalDispersion.R': Contains the MH algorithm to infer the parameters for the COMPoisson Goal model with global dispersions;
- 'MH_Football_COMPois_IndDispersion.R': Contains the MH algorithm to infer the parameters for the COMPoisson Goal model with individual dispersions.
